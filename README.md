# Euphoria 66

Euphoria 66 is my take on a no-limits, sustainable, fully automated, efficient, but still dupe pleasing colony in [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included). I created it to make up for all the horrible (or hilarious) ways I killed the dupes in all my previous games.

No-limits means I used debug mode to spawn geysers and Wheezeworts like there is no tomorrow. Also, most buildings are insta-build because I have no patience.

## Mods used

The following mods are required to run this colony:

* [Steel Ladder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1706075206) (A better ladder used only for the base itself)

* [Butcher & Fishing Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907824546) (Two buchter stations used in the base)

* [Wounded Go To Med Bed](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1822160024) (To ensure dupes will not run along with wounds)

## Installation

* Install the mods listed above as required
* (((Use the *Clone or download button* to download this [repository as ZIP](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/archive/master.zip))))
* Open the local path ``C:\Users\[your username]\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\save_files\`` e.g. ``C:\Users\John\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\save_files\``
* Copy the `*.SAV` file to this folder
* Start the game and load the colony "Euphoria 66"

NOTE #1: Loading the save will take at about 12-13 minutes (no joke!). After that, ONI will show a black and white screen of the colony and require some more minutes to fully intialize

NOTE #2: This save game will require **20-23 GB of memory**. So better close all those tabs in Chrome before.
