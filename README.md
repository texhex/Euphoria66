# Euphoria 66

Euphoria 66 is my take on a no-limits, sustainable, fully automated, efficient, but still dupe pleasing colony in [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included). I created it to make up for all the horrible (or hilarious) ways I killed my dupes in all my previous games.

No-limits means I used debug mode to spawn geysers and Wheezeworts like there is no tomorrow. Also, most buildings are insta-build because I have no patience.

## Welcome

Are you 30 Kg of Genetic Ooze ready to be printed? How about you visit us at Euphoria; you will surely enjoy your stay on our 384x672 asteroid our 66 inhabitants call home! *

*Restrictions: Narcoleptic, destructive or vomiter do not need to apply.*

## Oxygen

When joining our colony, you will never have to worry about the life-supporting blue gas, aka Oxygen. Our electrolyzer room is equipped with AETN cooling and a 5t water reserve if there is a temporary water shortage.

![electrolizer](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/electrolizer2.png)

One room can supply the entire colony, but to be sure, we have the exact same room as a backup. We duplicated those two rooms again as a backup-for-the-backup. And added two more as a backup-for-the-backup-for-the-backup for ... reasons.

## Food

Every day, our dedicated team of 8 cooks will use our two kitchens, with a total of four gas ranges and two electric grills, to make the best food for you to enjoy.

![cooking](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/cooking.png)

We serve Pepper Bread, Stuffed Berry, and Barbeque, so there is something for everyone. Of course, you will find table salt on your mess table always.

![food store room](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/foodstoreroom.png)

As all your friends are on the same schedule as you, you can have pleasant chitchat with them. Or they appreciate just how effective you can gnaw on your food.

![eating](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/eating.png)

The meat for our barbeque comes from our broad range of staples (Hatches, Dreckos, Slicksters, and Shove Voles), cared for by our 25 ranchers. The plants are all organic and germ-free, harvested by 26 farmers.

![hatches](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/hatches.png)

## Healthcare

Our health care system will make sure you are getting healthy again in no time. 24 triage cots, 18 sick bays, and 10 disease clinics with a team of twelve doctors trained in advanced medical care are ready to help you.

![health](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/health.png)

All our medication, from curative tablets up to serum vial are automatically and in-house produced, as needed.

## Germs

We have a rigorous germ-bashing policy at Euphoria 66: every single one of our 38 bathrooms has as many sinks as there are lavatories - on every entry. Of course, there is one lavatory and one shower for each inhabitant, so no waiting line when you want to use it.

The kitchen, food storeroom, and all main entrances are guarded by hand sanitizer. And any ore brought in needs to pass 12 ore scrubbers to make sure no germ makes into our colony.

![ore scrub](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/orescrubber2.png)

For outside activity, we have one atmo suit for each inhabitant ready to protect from the harsh environment. Except you are Frankie and decide to pass the atmo suite checkpoint without one. Don't be like Frankie.

![frankie](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/frankieatmo.png)

All atmo suits are stored in chlorine, so even if you needed to work in a slime biome, the next cycle, your atmo suit will be ready germ-free.

![air lock](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/airlock2.png)

## Power

Our primary source for electrical power is our array of solar panels.

![solar power](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/solarpower.png)

If the solar panels can't produce any power, we utilize natural gas generators, so there is always enough electricity available. For specific areas, we have localized power generation from hydrogen, lumber, coal, ethanol, and petroleum.

## Dupe Dojo

When there are no errands for you to do, you can use our 48 manual generators within our dupe dojo. Not only can you enjoy the gorgeous decor and have your tootsies tickled while using it, but it will also increase your athletics and machinery skills.

![dupe dojo](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/dupedojo.png)

After 33 seconds, you will be gently slammed on the ground to take care of any errands that might have become available in the meanwhile.

## Stress

We all know it, stress is bad - so we have done everything to prevent it. All areas, even the hallways, are equipped with picture masterpieces and genius sculptures to make your stay a pleasure.

But in case you need them, we also offer 32 massage tables. Just to be safe, not because you will need them - ever.

Our main debris storage area, near the core of the asteroid, is designed so you can easily access any needed material from above, without the need to pass all those ugly debris piles.

![debris pile](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/debrispile.png)

## Downtime

Our five shift break policy, together with our vast transit tube network (within the base and outside), will ensure that you back at base in no time to enjoy your break.

We installed 66 soda fountains to allow everybody to enjoy a refreshing sparking spoda at the end of the cycle.

![soda fountain](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/sodafountain.png)

If you are more into coffein, we have you covered, too: 14 Espresso Machines are waiting for you. Feel like dancing, or are you into games? Eight jukebot, and 6 arcades await!

Finally, if you like high-powered wind through your hair there are four wind tunnels that allow you just that. 

![wind tunnel](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/raw/master/img/windtunnel2.png)

Of course, we have private bedrooms, all equipped with comfy beds, so that you can start your next cycle fully rested.

## Changes in v22+

* Beach Chairs replaced with Wind Tunnels (as the Beach Chair bugs is still unfixed)
* Sage Hatch and Hatch now feed on barbeque automatically
* Cooper, Iron and Gold Volcano added
* Clay Kitchen added
* Oil Biom fully explored and automated
* Oil Boiler changes so the leftovers are cooled and added to infinite storage
* New materials added to infinite storage and combined some (Cooper/Gold Amalgum for example)
* CO² storage (used for cooling) in space optimized
* Added Espresso machines and more arcades
* Reactivated regolith cooling (based on the schematics by Tony Advanced) and use it for the central water sives
* Fully explored and utilized the Sleet Wheat cavern
* Limited Ore Scrubber (Base Entrance) to 8, but therefore added a transit tube exit directly before the air lock. This should save some seconds per Dupe and cycle
* Invited Rocket Man to the colony - he is always away with his rocket Artemis and sings "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"
* Added 6 more dupe wheels in the Dupe Dojo. Because of other optimizations resulting in the message "Idle (3)"
