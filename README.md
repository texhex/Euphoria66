## Installation

* Install the mods listed above as required
* Use the *Clone or download button* to download this [repository as ZIP](https://github.com/texhex/Euphoria66/archive/master.zip)
* Open the local path ``C:\Users\[your username]\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\save_files\`` e.g. ``C:\Users\John\\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\save_files\``
* Copy the `*.SAV` to this folder
* Start the game and load the colony "Euphoria 66"

NOTE #1: Loading the save will take at about 12-13 minutes (no joke!). After that, ONI will show a black and white screen of the colony and requirse some more minutes to fully intialize

NOTE #2: The game will require 20-23 GB of memory to load it. So better close all those tabs in Chrome.
